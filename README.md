[Lawbringer ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882)﻿is a great mod that allows you to claim locations around Skyrim for a faction of your choice, ensuring that it will only respawn in the future with friendly NPCs. It is really enjoyable to claim locations and see a tangible impact on the world around you. Places like Valtheim Keep and Pine Watch Bridge are fun locations because they are bandit camps stationed on the roadway, so claiming feels very impactful.

This is the third in my series of Lawbringer addons. Previously I have brought law to [Wyrmstooth ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55190)and [Cyrodiil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57099), now it is Solstheim's turn! This mod will add support for three factions and three locations on the island of Solstheim.

House Redoran is one of the five Morrowind Great Houses, they see tradition and the way of the warrior of the greatest ideals of Dunmer life. After the eruption of Red Mountain the Redoran found themself in a position of power and ended up as one of the most powerful houses. They have controlled Solstheim for nearly two centuries but, despite their famed martial prowess, they are unable to exert much influence outside of Raven Rock due to the harsh conditions and lack of resources. There is much untapped potential on the island, potential that House Redoran would be very interested in exploiting if given the chance.

The East Empire Company is a trading business that is funded by the Empire but works independently from the government proper. They maintain a small but powerful standing army of mercenaries to protect their interests around Tamriel. Raven Rock was originally founded as a Company Colony in the late Third Era, however they were forced to move out of the island when Solstheim was given to Morrowind and House Redoran moved in. While the East Empire Company has largely ignored the island since they pulled out, the reopening of the Raven Rock Mine has prompted them to consider their current position.\

Thirsk is a free-standing mead hall near the center of Solstheim. It used to be controlled by a group of Nord warriors, but they were recently run out by a tribe of reiklings. Now calling themselves "Thirsk Tribe", the reiklings have become emboldened by their victory over the Nords and look at challenege the many other reikling tribes that inhabit the island.

Broken Tusk Mine is a small heart stone mine between [Bristleback Cave](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bristleback_Cave)﻿ and [Stalhrim Source](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stalhrim_Source)﻿, home to a group of rieklings. While heart stones may not be a precious metal House Redoran and the East Empire Company can both see that it is of value to mages and know they would be able to turn a profit with it. For the Thrisk Tribe the mine offers a comfortable and safe location for the tribe to expand to.

Damphall Mine is a large iron and silver mine north of [Bloodskal Barrow](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodskal_Barrow)﻿, home to a group of reavers. The mine is very large and contains several veins of silver and iron, the resources within would be a boon to both the East Empire Company and House Redoran if it could be claimed.

Moesring Pass is a mountain pass due northwest of the [Temple of Miraak](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Temple_of_Miraak)﻿, inhabited by rieklings guarding the nearby Strange Vessel. House Redoran and the East Empire Company both has a vested interest in investigating the piece of Dwemer tech locations here, the Thirsk Tribe just thinks it looks like a nice place to live.

**Recommended Mods**

In the base game the East Empire Company does not have a unique aesthetic, the mercenaries you see in Rise in the East wear Imperial Legion Armor and the East Empire Wardens from Scoundrel's Folly just wear Steel Armor. So, it is highly recommended that you use [East Empire Company Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54990)﻿ (seen in the screenshots) alongside this mod. It will equip the East Empire Company with a new unique set of armor that will make the faction much more aesthetically interesting.

Without this mod installed the East Empire Wardens added to claimed locations will just use the Steel Armor outfit from Scoundrel's Folly.
